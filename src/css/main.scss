/**
 * CSS architecture is 'ITCSS' (Inverted Triangle CSS)

 */

// Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
@import "1-settings/variables";

// Tools – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
@import "2-tools/mixins";

// Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.

// Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
@import "4-elements/typography";

// Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
@import "5-objects/containers";

// Components – specific UI components. This is where the majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components
@import "6-components/show-more-button";

// Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
@import "7-utilities/display-visibility";
@import "7-utilities/space";
@import "7-utilities/colors";
